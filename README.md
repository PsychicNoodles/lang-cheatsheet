# lang-cheatsheet

A simple SPA with a few useful cheatsheets/tools for various languages, focusing on Korean and Japanese. Application code uses [Material UI](http://material-ui.com). Test code uses [Cucumber](http://cucumber.io) in Ruby, because I like Ruby better than Node. Server is located at http://localhost:3000.

The output code is purely HTML/CSS/Javascript, so you can throw it somewhere like GitHub pages and have it served without any real backend.

Application code:
```
npm install # install node modules
npm start # serve it locally
npm build # just build it
```

Test code:
```
gem install bundler # if you've never programmed in Ruby before
bundle install # install gems
bundle exec cucumber # run cucumber tests
```
